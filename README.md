# Nowhere
This is a partially in-development project, and while it can be run in its current state, it is nowhere near completion.
Nowhere uses Java 10.

*These could all be fixed, but most are related to unimplemented features which would eliminate the need for the fix.*
## Known Issues

* The WAIT skill does not generate the proper debugging statements.
* The GUI does not update stat bars and stat values properly when the buttons are pressed again before the animations end.
* THE ADVERSARY somehow able to initiate combat with THE MAN even after being defeated.
* Only about 40% of the documentation that should be there is actually there. *Unfortunately, this will not automatically be fixed by future features.*
