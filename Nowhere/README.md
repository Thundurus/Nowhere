# Nowhere
This is a partially in-development project, and while it can be run in its current state, it is nowhere near completion.
Nowhere uses Java 10.

*These could all be fixed, but most are related to unimplemented features which would eliminate the need for the fix.*
## Known Issues

* The WAIT skill does not generate the proper debugging statements.
* The GUI does not update stat bars and stat values properly when the buttons are pressed again before the animations end.
* THE ADVERSARY somehow able to initiate combat with THE MAN even after being defeated.
* Only about 40% of the documentation that should be there is actually there. *Unfortunately, this will not automatically be fixed by future features.*

## Next Steps

* (Done) Create a more precise method for altering existing Characters.
* (Done) Create an executable test combat scenario.

* Hook command line input to a controllable character. //No longer needed.
* Create a basic AI for the NPC enemies to use in battles. //I have decided to make this a much bigger thing.

* Create a system for compiling parsable battle data from battles.
* Explain what the project is about in a way that does not require one to fully read all of the code.
* ...
* Develop the baseline AI for NPC opponents.
* ...
* Include enough character skills for an MVP.
* Make the GUI agnostic to screen resolution.
* Implement a character creation system.
* Make the GUI less ugly.
* Aggregate combat data from testing.
